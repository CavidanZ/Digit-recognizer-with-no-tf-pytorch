A simple digit recognizer that uses only numpy, pytorch and pandas. 
The dataset taken is from kaggle, namely: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer
If you don't want to kaggle, I have supplied the dataset as a zip file as well, called train.rar.
The recognizer achieves around 84% accuracy, which is good enough considering it is a simply deep learning model.
